# Distributions

Theoretical distributions in statistical learning are important in abstracting  a random experiment in order to generalize the randomness involved in the experiment. 
Such an exercise will include the nature and assumption about the parameters (random but unknown) and about the data that could be generated from the experiment
For example, coin tossing is a random experiment with two possible mutually exclusive events. The outcome can be either head or tail but unpredictable and a possible interest could be proportion of heads (or tails). Here, outcome is categorical and the parameter is a measurable one which lies between 0 and 1. This way it is possible to generalize the abstract notions observed from an experiment and other assumptions (if any) and derive a mathematical form for the random experiment
While describing the form (mathematically) to explain the perceived relationships, functional forms are useful.
